Work through the following tasks in order.
Each task should be completed before moving on to the next:
Identify if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backwards as forwards) or not. For example, "aha" is a palindrome but "camel" is not.
When determining if a string is a palindrome, strings should be treated as case-insensitive and all punctuation other than spaces should be ignored. For example, "racecar" and "Yay!" are palindromes, but "race car" and "sprout?" are not.
Given a list of words, return only the ones that are palindromes. For example, an input of ["oh", "hah", "yep", "mm"] would return ["hah", "mm"].
Using the Dictionary API, look up a given word and return a dict of information on that word. If the word is not found in the dictionary, raise a ValueError.
Given a list of palindromes, return only those which are nouns.
You can find a list of words in the words.txt file. Load this data, and answer the following questions:
What is the longest palindrome?
What is the longest palindromic noun?
What part of speech has the most palindromes?
What palindrome has the most separate meanings?
